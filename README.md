# BackupHelper

**This project was created on an impulse to learn about how to work with writing files in Java and also how scripts (.bat, .sh) work and making the scripts run software. The thought about it was for a person that plays a game with automatic saving can use this tool to make backups and go back in the savings if something happened in the game that the player didn't like and wants to undo.**

**BackupHelper is a program written in Java which is using .bat (on Windows) and .sh (Mac and Linux) scripts that copies a folder to another location when the source folder has been modified (checks this every minutes), to make it easy to store backups.**

* **This program requires that latest version of Java is installed on the computer**
